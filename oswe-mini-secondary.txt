GitHub Copilot: Hi — I'll implement a small, accessible web form that matches the "Tech Advise / Research" spec and add validation + a README so you can test it locally. Next I'll make a short plan and inspect the repository before adding files.

Created 3 todos

Proceeding to inspect the repository and current files so I know where to add the new form.

Starting: *Inspect workspace* (1/3)

Searched for files matching `**/*`, 1 match

Nice — I found only Propmt2.txt in the repository, which contains the full form spec. My next step is to implement the form UI files (HTML/CSS/JS) that match the spec and add a README explaining how to test it.

Starting: *Create form UI* (2/3)

Time to add the new form files (HTML/CSS/JS) into a new folder `tech-advise-form/` and implement validation.

Using "Apply Patch"

My next step is to add styling, client-side behavior, and a README to explain how to test the form locally.

```
I added the form HTML, styling and client-side JS; next I'll finish the README and wrap up the form package.

Starting: *Add README and usage instructions* (3/3)

Completed: *Add README and usage instructions* (3/3)

Perfect — I implemented the static form, styling, and client-side validation matching the spec from Propmt2.txt and added a README. My next step is to show you how to run and test it, and explain which fields I made required.✅ Done — I implemented a small, accessible static web form for "Tech Advise / Research" (for small-business volunteer / quid-pro-quo projects) and added validation + a README.

---

## What I changed / added 🔧
I created a new folder in your workspace: tech-advise-form with the following files:
- index.html — the form implementation (fields, structure, accessibility)
- style.css — styling and responsive layout
- script.js — client-side validation and a JSON preview on submit
- README.md — quick usage instructions

---

## How the form implements your specification ✅
- Form type: "Tech Advise / Research" — intended for small-business volunteer or quid-pro-quo projects only (note shown in UI).
- Platform Technology (dropdown, required): Archer, AWS Cloud, Windows Desktop, Web Application, Database, SAI360.
- Languages (multiple selection; optional): JavaScript, PHP, .NET, Python, SQL (checkboxes).
- Payment (required): Volunteer or Quid Pro Quo (radio).
- Codebase (multiple selection; optional): React, Node, Flask, Laravel, FastAPI, VuesticUI (checkboxes).
- Project Context:
  - Project Name — required
  - Timeline to complete — dropdown (required): 1 month, 2 month, 3 month, 5 month, 8 month, 13 month.
  - IT team size — dropdown (optional): 0,1,2,3,5,8.
  - Need — textarea (required): to document the need / project description.

Note: I used best judgement for required fields — Project Name, Timeline, Need, Platform Technology and Payment are required. Languages, Codebase, and IT team size are optional.

## How to view / test it (quick) 🧭
You can open the form directly in your browser:
1. Open `.../v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/tech-advise-form/index.html` in your browser.

Or run a simple local HTTP server (PowerShell examples):
- If you have Python available:
```powershell
cd .\tech-advise-form;
python -m http.server 8000;
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser
```
- Or just double-click `index.html` in the folder to open it.

Submit the form — the page performs client-side validation and shows a JSON preview of the submitted data (no backend).

---

## Next steps / options (if you'd like) 💡
- Hook the form to a backend endpoint for persistence or notifications.
- Add more audit fields (contact info, business name) or attach file support.
- Improve UX: inline validation messages, better accessibility enhancements, or unit tests.

---

If you'd like, I can:
- integrate a server endpoint and demo submission,
- or expand the UI (for example add forms for other categories mentioned in your workspace).

Would you like me to connect this form to a backend or make any of the optional fields required?

Made changes.
