now, i need you to configure results.html page.
The page should have a dropdown which holds values from 1950 to 2025 but can only display 5 consequent values at a time. However the landing page should show values only from 2021 to 2025 allowing user to scroll back till 1950.
the api used are
https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/
<<year>>.json
and
https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/
<<year>>/<<round>>/results.json
where the value <<year>> should correspond to the value of year selected in the drop down.
Once a year is selected the page should display all the races in the year using the API: 'https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/
<<year>>.json'.
for example, if year 2017 is selected in the drop down, the page should list all races below the drop down for the year 2017 using the API:
'https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/2017.json
'
You can get the total number of rounds that season by reading the value for 'total' in the json file. For 2017, the value is "total":"23", the total number of rounds that year is 23. So on selecting 2017, create a table with 23 rows each listing the corresponding round.
Now when the user hits a round, the results for that round should be displayed by using the API: 'https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/
<<year>>/<<round>>/results.json'
where <<year>> is the corresponding year selected for that race and <<round>> is the value of "round" specified in the API 'https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/
<<year>>.json' for that particular year.
