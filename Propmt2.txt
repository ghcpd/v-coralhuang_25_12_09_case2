You are a university registrar checking the new course catalog for errors. You are given a list of
N courses (numbered 0 to N-1) and a list of M prerequisite requirements. A requirement u v
means "course u must be taken before course v".
A "prerequisite paradox" exists if there is a circular dependency (e.g., Course A needs B, B
needs C, and C needs A). Your task is to determine if the course catalog contains any such
paradoxes.
Input Format:
● The first line: Two integers, N (number of courses) and M (number of requirements).
● The next M lines: Two integers u and v per line.
Output Format:
● Print PARADOX if a cycle is detected.
● Print VALID if no cycles exist.
Sample Test Case:
Input:
4 4
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 1
Output:
