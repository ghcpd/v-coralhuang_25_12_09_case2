GitHub Copilot: Thanks — I fixed typos and drafted a concise form spec and required-field recommendations. Do you want this as a JSON Schema, plain HTML form, or a React component (and if React, plain or using a UI lib)?

Suggested form (fields, types, required):
- Form title: "Tech Advise / Research" (for volunteer / quid pro quo projects — small businesses only)
- Eligibility: "Is this a small business?" (checkbox or implicit validation) — required
- Project Name (string, text input) — required
- Platform Technology (dropdown) — options: Archer, AWS Cloud, Windows Desktop, Web Application, Database, SAI360 — required
- Languages (multi-select) — options: JavaScript, PHP, .NET, Python, SQL — optional
- Payment (radio/dropdown) — options: Volunteer, Quid Pro Quo — required
- Codebase (multi-select) — options: React, Node, Flask, Laravel, FastAPI, VuesticUI — optional
- Project Context / Need (textarea) — prompt: "Describe the project and need" — required
- Timeline (dropdown) — options: 1 month, 2 month, 3 month, 5 month, 8 month, 13 month — required
- IT team size (dropdown) — options: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 — optional
- Submit button and client-side validation (ensure small-business eligibility; required fields filled)

If that matches your intent I can implement it now (create JSON Schema and an HTML form + simple validation, or a React component). Which format do you want me to add to the repo?

User: choose the way u think is best

GitHub Copilot: Creating a JSON Schema and a simple HTML form with client-side validation; next step: add both files to the repo.

Done — I added a JSON Schema and a simple HTML form with client-side validation. Would you like a React component or automated tests next?

Made changes.
