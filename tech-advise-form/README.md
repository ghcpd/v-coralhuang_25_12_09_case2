# Tech Advise / Research — Small Business Form

This is a small static HTML form implementing the `Tech Advise / Research` specification from `Propmt2.txt`.

Files
- index.html — the form UI
- style.css — styling and layout
- script.js — client-side validation and JSON preview

Which fields are required (my judgement)
- Project name — required
- Timeline — required
- Describe the need (textarea) — required
- Platform Technology — required
- Payment / arrangement — required

Optional fields: Languages, Codebase, IT team size

How to try it
1. Open the folder `tech-advise-form`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use an HTTP server).

This is a static demo — it validates client-side and shows the submission preview as JSON (no backend attached).
