GitHub Copilot: I can see this is a specification for a form related to "Tech Advise / Research" projects. However, I need clarification on what you'd like me to do:

1. **Create a form** based on this specification (HTML, React, or another framework)?
2. **Convert this to a structured format** (JSON schema, database schema, etc.)?
3. **Build a full application** with this form?
4. **Something else** with this specification?

Could you let me know what you'd like me to build or implement?

820234338: Create a form based on this specification (HTML, React, or another framework

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a React form based on the specification. Let me first check the workspace structure to understand the project setup. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2)

The workspace only has a git repo and a text file. I'll create a complete React form component for the "Tech Advise / Research" form based on your specification. 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/TechAdviseForm.jsx)

Now I'll create the accompanying CSS file for styling: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/TechAdviseForm.css)

Now I'll create an example App component and package.json to show how to use the form: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/App.jsx)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/App.css)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/package.json)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/index.jsx)

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/public/index.html)

Finally, I'll create a README with setup and usage instructions: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/README.md)

Done! I've created a complete React form based on your specification. Here's what I built:
