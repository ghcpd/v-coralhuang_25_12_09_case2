GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...I can see you have a specification for a "Tech Advise / Research" form with specific fields and validation requirements. However, I need clarification on what you'd like me to do with this:

1. **Create a form implementation** (HTML, React component, or other framework)?
2. **Create a database schema** to store this data?
3. **Create an API endpoint** to handle this form?
4. **Something else entirely?**

Could you let me know what technology/framework you're using and what you'd like me to build based on this specification?

centifictest: Create a form implementation

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a form implementation based on your specification. Let me first check the repository structure to determine the best technology stack. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2)

Let me check if there's any existing project configuration: 

Ran terminal command: Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Bug_Bash\25_12_09\v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2" -Force -Recurse | Select-Object -First 20

Since this is a fresh repository, I'll create a React form component that implements your "Tech Advise / Research" specification. This is a modern, flexible approach that works well for complex forms. 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/TechAdviseForm.jsx)

Now I'll create the CSS styling file: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/TechAdviseForm.css)

Now I'll create a simple example/demo file showing how to use the form: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/App.jsx)

Finally, let me create a comprehensive README documenting the form: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_09/v-coralhuang_25_12_09_case2/README.md)

Perfect! I've created a complete React form implementation based on your specification. Here's what I've built:
